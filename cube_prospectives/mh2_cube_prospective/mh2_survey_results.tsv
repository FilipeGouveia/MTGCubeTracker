3.0: Lose Focus"	"Tons of cracked-out interaction and juiced-up cheap threats are a good recipe to generate an absurdly long testing list. Not much to say when the rate of cards like Damn and Solitude speak for themselves.

Most interesting to me as a Cube designer are the effects whose power I can tune contextually -- in particular, the set's Delirium, Domain, and Converge cards. By including Baubles, extra fetchlands, and looting effects, I'm hoping these cards will introduce a next-level dimension to deckbuilding."

The mythic incarnation cycle is getting a lot of talk, but I'm currently of the opinion that they're not as strong or interesting as people think. Going down a card for an effect that is not fundamentally altering the outcome of the game on a regular basis (Force of Will/Force of Negation) is a lot harder in cube than it is in constructed(I'm specifically referring to my own environment, which is unpowered but reasonably power optimized with many games lasting around or upwards of 6 turns). I'm still pretty high on the White and Black ones since I think they have reasonable floors as creatures, but I'll be avoiding the other three for now. I'll be interested to see how they play for everyone and if my opinion will be changed, but in testing so far I have only liked Grief and Solitude."

R/W modular: I feel like the set didn't do quite enough to make this archetype fit in my cube. Arcbound Shikari isnt quite enough to carry the archetype. I don't want it to just be a colorless creature archetype, so I was disappointed with how few R or W creatures there were.

B/R madness: This archetype didn't need more enablers, it needed more payoffs. It sadly didn't really get any. Kind of a shame as I run a discard theme in R for my cube. Terminal Agony being a bad terminate is really lame.

W/B reanimator: Priest of the Fell Rites is a sweet card. What more needs to be said?

B/G squirrels: I dislike the squirrels tribe because they are just elves but... squirrels. Too many slots had to be given up for the basics of a tribal theme that hasn't ever had support before.

Evoke cycle: Whoo what an awesome set of cards. While I am only currently testing the U and B ones, all 5 might see play in my cube at some point.


Ragavan is in my cube, but his powerlevel is so absurd, might cut him"

I really appreciate all the support for +1/+1 counters, which has always been an almost-there mechanic for pauper environments.  Madness can probably be supported at this point, but it's a touch too narrow/linear for my tastes.  I feel a bit torn with affinity/modular - it has little support historically, and leads to very linear decks, but maybe can get there one day with more sets like MH2."

2: Urza's Saga"	"Wow, great set over all. Absolutely great design. I really love WotC for the flexibility they show when designing a set for a higher powerlevel. While we got a lot of interesting stuff in the last 2 years this it outshine by both MH1 and 2 by a large margin. The ability to just do makes horizon sets the perfect playground and I love every single bit of it. I mean storm on a creature? Or just making green a third good storm color in general would have been impossible. We got so many tools to rethink everything. I thought about following, most players are probably introduced to cube by MTGO and are therefore biased with traditional storm decks, but imagine creating an environment where green is not the stompy value go big deck but rather se secondary storm color. Red could now be concentrated on other archetypes such as big red or artifact matters.

I am very exited so see the next month and years to come. "

It really powered up already existing archetypes - Reanimator, 2 new red 1-drop staples, aswell as the ""free"" evoke mythic cycle, which can be combo'd with flicker effects - while also introducing probably the coolest and most interesting mechanics we've seen in quite a few years, to name a few: Grist's passive effect, mixing Surveil with Delirium, replicate on countermagic, the Boros modular archetype, and even things that might not end up in all cubes but have great designs nonetheless, like Garth One-Eye and Squirrel Tribal. While cutting and introducing new cards to my cube, it really felt like this set allowed for high levels of cross-pollination between archetypes, which is a thing a curator is always thankful for."

1: The Underworld Cookbook"	"For the legendary creatures cube Ragavan is the one standout. Asmor is similar but the discard theme isn't as strong and doesn't have any payouts. If it performs well, add some madness spells Anje. I worry doing so would encroach on the BW knights archetype as it would share cards with BR vampires. Not sure I can support both tribes because the depth of vampire lords at legendary sucks (pun intended). Edgar is good but (this is NOT a commander cube), he locks you hard into Mardu. Invevitable betrayal and Suspend are fun in Blue. I like suspend but it is likely not going to stick because it's just a bit cheeky. I already run Snap and the likes and not sure it is better. Those are supposed to run with isocrhon scepter though so it definitely fits there. The wild card here is General Ferrous Rokiric: the removal is mostly mono colored so they are fairly safe. Multi-color matters is already present with Rienne so it might make that a real strategy and not just a good synergy."

Also, I really wish there was a version that included the evoke reminder text.  While I dislike reminder text aestetically, my playgroup has multiple players that are less enfranchised and don't have 28 years of keywords memorized.  I am likely to proxy those cards with the added rules text for my testing purely for that reason."

I especially like cards such as Glimmer Bairn and Drey Keeper that get to make fun references for those in magic, but also be some interesting design choices to the table. It also wonderful that Wizards now has a practical way to make fun and interesting cards with mismatched and older keywords like with Bannerhide Krushok, which fills a lot of design space for a cube and allows for a ton of utility on a single common card. Definitely returning to cards that have keyword that emphasize such broad categories as +1/+1 counters and tokens really helps to bolster cube design and to have more cards to fill in more themes with less cards to make much more flexible cubes and more enjoyable drafts.  I'm also excited that we got another set of some common gold cards. Its very exciting to be able to switch around some gold cards again, especially after the unique situation of being able to do it with a standard set for Strixhaven. I hope that is a theme that continues for the non-standard sets."

MH2 brought us one three color card that was a slam dunk in: Dakkon, Shadow Slayer and another three color mana dork in Ignoble Hierarch.  The only other card that got the 3.0 for me is Damn, as it is a strict upgrade to Wrath of God, with the advantage of encouraging multicolor.  

The cards that I am just testing Ragavan, which I worry may be too powerful for my environment.  Chatterfang appears to be a great token build around, which I have been looking for, as it has a much better floor than a Doubling Season.  Unmarked Grave and and Ravenous Squirrel also fill archetypes that I support, their future inclusion will be dependent on their performance.  "

I still have updates to do from Kald and Strixhaven, but these sets and their commander products weren't very desirable to me. I am also relieved to not be seeing more MDFC, as I feel for cubes that follow more traditional draft formats that not having a land on the back added unnecessary complexity to the draft. 

My top 3 cards from this set are, Ignoble Hierarch, Ragavan, and Tourach. I think Jund is the clear winner of MH2, I didn't feel White or Blue got the same love that they received back in MH1.  "

Timeless Dragon seems like it is the best Cube card in Modern Horizons 2. While it is far from the single most powerful card in the set, it makes up for it in raw flexibility. I expect Timeless Dragon to see play in Cubes of all sizes and power levels for a very long time. "

Not as many options for my unrestricted budget cube. I don't add anything more than $5 at time of purchase to this list. Praying for presale prices to go down. 

I've been working on a list for a high-synergy cube too. I might just use MH2 as a shell and add cards that are more relevant to the archetypes. "

W: Prismatic Ending comes at a great time since I'm moving to doubling up on fetches. Timeless Dragon is notable for actually being a creature Wx control decks want. Esper Sentinel is a headscratcher... busted or garbage?
U: Hard Evidence is G A S and I'll enjoy it in artifact decks especially. I suspect Subtlety to appear mostly in Tempo, but it's brutal there.
B: Big push for mono black from Voidwalker, Grief and Tourach. This deck has to be on the level of Mono Red now in terms of sheer power.
R: Curious just how oppressive Ragavan will be. I hope my removal is efficient enough to answer him. Such as Fury, for example. Love the idea of jamming that card in RG alongside Kessig Wolfrun.
G: Ignoble Hierarch ratchets up the mana dork count by one more, which is great. That's often a bottleneck for my green decks.
M: Grist is my favourite card from MH2. Just such an awesome toolbox piece, exactly what the doctor ordered for golgari. Rakdos Headliner is a sleeper I think. Dakkon might as well be a UW or UB hybrid card, since those decks can almost always produce esper mana somehow.

Not because they aren’t good cards but because they’re the type of good cards that if someone posted them to a custom card forum they’d be laughed out for their overpushed designs. I really hope Modern Horizons hits diminishing returns for WoTC and they stop printing insane cards to bypass standard (and also they quit trying to make modern into Legacy to bypass action on the Reserve List).

2.5: Goblin Bombardment"	"Overall, Modern Horizons 2 feels much more like a Time Spiral 2 set to me, than a genuine continuation of Modern Horizons. The difference might be minuscule (after all, the original MH1 set was pitched as a new Time Spiral set initially), but whereas the original MH1 set was welcoming for less enfranchised players, MH2 goes fully into the deep end of the pool. 

My cube is designed with newer players in mind. Thus, some cards were just too complex, had too many moving parts or required too much knowledge about obscure mechanics and interactions, didn't make the cut.

If my cube is like a kitchen cabinet, with beautiful silver cutlery, Grist would be the stainless steel Swiss Army Knife that sticks out as a sore thumb. This is not the exciting effect I want to see in Golgari. 

Flametongue Yearling is just bad, I can't believe people are hyped about this card. A red 2-drop you can't play on an empty board, and a worse FTK – a card that rarely finds place in unpowered fair stuff legacy-styled cubes.

Murktide Regent and Ignoble Hierarch are cards I'll probably try in the future, but not right now.

I loved the artifact subtheme, and the new direction for Boros!"

2.5: Fire // Ice"	"My Hot Take for MH2: Bone Shards is one of the best black removal spells every printed for cube because it also serves as an enabler for multiple black based unfair strategies. At a base line it it costs a single mana and your worse token/creature on board or the worst card in your hand to destroy your opponents best creature or walker. From there, if your cube supports any sort of reanimator, recursion or aristocrats/sacrifice matters strategies this card's potential just goes through the roof. Even minor synergies like delve, threshold, delirium will love the extra card in the yard that you get at the low, low cost of destroying your opponents best creature/planeswalker. I can't wait to cube this card and I look forward to seeing this get played in the most powerful environments for years to come."
