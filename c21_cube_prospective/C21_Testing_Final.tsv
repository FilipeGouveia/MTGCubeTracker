andymangold	Unrestricted	https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/degenerate-micro-cube	2.6: Triplicate Titan	Triplicate Titan is a great piece for my very rude, combo-focused cube! More castable than Ancient Stone Idol in addition to being better with Flash and Goblin Welder.

I think people are sleeping on Keen Duelist, since it isn't Bob (Dark Confidant). However, it is still a cheap creature that can generate advantage. And in a control or reanimator deck, you can damage your opponent fairly significantly, especially if you have ways to stack the top of your library."

2.6: Triplicate Titan"	"Better than the main set. I've decided to include the whole theme of the Lorehold deck into my cube, including the face commander, as a way to reinvent and rejuvenate the Boros section in my cube (I'll also be making other changes as well). Other than that, Fain, the Broker is like a black Retrofitter Foundry that always has a good mode available, but suffers from being a black 3-drop. I expect Laelia to become a staple through the years to come, I believe she's literally better than Rabblemaster (she *draws cards!!!*). Ruin Grinder is kinda overlooked as a Welder deck target, and even I had a hard time evaluating it in any way. But the fact it bins itself, has evasion, and has a relevant death trigger (even if that death trigger seemingly allows your opponent to benefit from it too) really puts it into the viable category.

There are some cards I won't be testing for other reasons. Archaeomancer's Map just doesn't fit my design goals, but can be very good in land-based ramp environments. The shuffling isn't flavor text either. Paradox Zone is probably the second-best card for cube in terms of raw power level for the entire set, but just seems boring and uninteractive to me."

Fain is an interesting value engine that probably isn't strong enough, but is a very interesting card that offers a lot of choice, which is fun.
Laelia is just a super powerful red card that fits in aggressive and midrange decks and has synergy with other random cards. All in all a slam dunk of a card."

2.6: Triplicate Titan"	We're already testing 8 cards from Strixhaven, so we decided to avoid borderline cards and rely on others playtesting. At our cube size of 720+, Triplicate Titan is welcome redundancy for every cheat archetype: it's great in the sneak archetype, reanimator, artifact reanimator, tinker, oath, etc. Pest Infestation has enough going for it that it will probably become a permanent fixture of the cube. It works in the token archetype without requiring targets and offering a great rate; the tokens help midrange stabilize with life gain and chump blockers; it works as a 3-for-1 plus at 5 mana, which is awesome. I don't think that cutting rec sage for this is correct since blink, pod, and rec nightmare decks will still prefer sage, but we're always looking to increase the amount of A/E hate, keeping the older unfair A/Es in check (stax artifacts, opposition, sneak, animate dead, oath, swords, etc.)

2.5: Triplicate Titan"	Triplicate titan is the exact type of card I want for my cube, which still runs a cheaty-style deck that includes reanimator, sneak attack, and tinker. Unlike the top-tier uncastable cheaty threats, it is interactable but still leaves behind something when answered or at end of turn with sneak attack
