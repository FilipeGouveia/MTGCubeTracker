Feldmanny	Custom (unrestricted)	https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/bonanza	There are lots of cards that I would test if I weren't on customs - notably Starnheim Unleashed, Esika's Chariot, Cosima, Halvar, and Valki - which with the exception of Valki and Starnheim I think will prove to be quite good.

For testing the runes... I will be add in all 5, the crown, and the tutor dwarf. The plan is when you draft the crown you also get the runes and the dwarf. Not all 7 cards will be in the draft packs.

vinterheart	Peasant	http://cubecobra.com/cube/list/fr0st	"I'm tempted to add snow basics, but seeing as it would only allow me to add Icehide Golem and maybe Blizzard Strix? Seems not really worth the effort at present. That being said it would be really flavorful.

Kaldheim as a set is extremely parasitic. Most of the non-evergreen mechanics (aside from the ""cast 2 spells"" and ""Boast"" cards) really need a critical mass to work. Foretell has the same issues as morph, where the upside-down card isn't really a mystery. Tribal is tribal, and snow is neat, but really requires a lot of support."	no
Boourns	Unrestricted	cubecobra.com/cube/list/poweredpupper	"I play a vintage powered cube. This set has a lot of interesting cards, and I feel like the draft of this set alone would be an absolute blast. Im tempted to make a set cube just to play with this alone.

OGTPapa	Unrestricted	https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/bolas	I do not like the idea of including snow. Kaldheim has very low power level for cube. The foretell cards can only be included together and right now I'm struggling to find several cuts to test them.	no
Anthony Mattox	Unrestricted	https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/regular		no
Trinity	Unrestricted		Snow is still awkward due to having no meaningful downside or counterplay. Foretell is my favourite mechanic in a long time, feels a lot like Suspend mixed with Cycling for helping smooth curves and stagger your mana costs. Kaldheim's themes are okay, the individual cards are mostly a little weak but none egregiously so. Overall a pretty good set. Standout card is definitely Usher of the Fallen and the good white cards are very welcome.	no

Vivanter	One Drops	https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/1dropcube	I tend to like creature-combat oriented mechanics and I like the new MDFC's quite a bit, but strangely I am mostly excited about the pathways being opened up as a landtype that doesn't punish aggro so heavily but also isn't just wildly better than a tapped land.	no

amschock	Unrestricted	https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/5d5f6ea72af66a30f9bba2ec	"I would include snow lands if there were cards that fit my power level that were irreplaceable. Only Dead of Winter seems to be a card I would be willing to warp my lands for, which just isn't enough to take the leap to snow lands for. I could play Icehide Golem, Icefang Coatl, On Thin Ice, and Arcum's Astrolabe, but I just dont feel these cards are enough to justify explaining why my basic lands are also snow lands every draft, or buying a bunch of snow lands to enable these cards. 

As for Kaldheim cards, only Usher the Fallen (over Dragon Hunter) is a slam dunk. I will be trying out two foretell cards in Starnheim Unleashed (over Emeria' Call) and Doomskar (over Shatter the Sky). Starnheim Unleashed I believe is playable at face value alone, but I wanted to try Doomskar for its wrath on turn three potential. I get that it is a worse top deck than Shatter the Sky, but the upside is there. It may not last over the more reliable. Valki, God of Lies (over Asylum Visitor) disruption may not be the best, but its something early. If he gets to change into something even better. I'm also cheating it into my list by calling it a mono black card as I don't think Tibalt will be cast often."	no
FannyBabbs	Unrestricted	https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/1ko	Set looks to be high complexity, medium power. That's an incredibly tough combination to get right, which probably means the cards are either much, much better or much, much worse than they look.	no

Irishlawyer	Unrestricted		Kaldheim is honestly the set that broke me.  I haven't played paper cube since before the pandemic, and online cube play isn't the same.  I just couldn't absorb almost half of the cards this spoiler season, the text just went in one ear & out the other, so to speak.  So many belligerent paragraphs of text, or complicated niche effects that don't matter for (at least my) cube.  I think I'm done updating my cube, for a while.	no

(Reminds me of Morph)  I love Doomskar but I don't like the others enough to include it.

Vinosdoh	Unrestricted	https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/kamilah	I probably get a bit too excited with modal cards, so me judging the MDFCs highly is possibly a bit of an overestimation.

Snow objections most relate to the choice of basics, but also partially that I don't want to deal with player expectations when snow basics are handled differently in draft and cube.

The Zendikar3/Kaldheim Split Card-DFC mechanic is hostile to non-digital limited formats, so it blocks out a third category of cards from testing.

My preorders and testing list are bullish on Foretell, in part because some of its cards look good, in part because I think higher density/visibility will be less confusing for testing with players who aren't up to date on new cards."	no

dirkjammer97	Unrestricted	https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/commandercube	My cube is a commander cube. Kaldheim looks like a blast, and I love how unusual many of the cards are (and are worded).	no
dirkjammer97	Unrestricted	https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/dirklegacycube	Not too many cards for a traditional legacy cube, but the set looks fun to draft!	basics

Cythare	Unrestricted	www.cubecobra.com/c/_	"I'm excited about this set. It doesn't have the quantity of hit-you-over-the-head includes that the past few sets have felt like they've had, but has a reasonable number of cards that are cool and that I'm not testing now, but fit into the ""I'd like to keep this in the on-deck binder to keep things exciting"" group, which for me is a great place for a set to be.

I'm also super excited to complete the Pathway land cycle."	no
Vorks	Unrestricted	https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/vorks	My first thought was that Kaldheim wasn't going to add much to my cube, however the more I dive in the more I find, I've now added 11 cards to test. My cube is unrestricted low power. Having an equipment theme in my cube I was disappointed in how little I recieved. I feel Foretell will be a bit like Morph, in that with only a couple of cards, your opponent will know exactly the card you're playing. Boast was a very average mechanic, but I always like adding new design elements to the cube and I think Dragonkin Berserker will perform fairer than Dragonmaster Outcast in my cube. More Changlings in Kaldeheim was great to provide support to less popular archtypes like Golems and Sphinxes, Masked Vandal will play a good role there whilst still proving a necessary utility.	no

CPAOI88	Unrestricted	https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/jdpu	With snow, a ridiculous amount of gold cards, tribal....this set had a lot going on that limited the scope of cards that would be good for non-snow (I personally hate it) cubes.  However, we found that the good, boradly applicable cards were so good that we still got a lot out of the set.  Some cards will be left out of the testing list because they're obviously vanilla staples going forward, like Usher of the Fallen.  We're a Historic cube for Arena play, so we're testing some stuff that is obviously outclassed in an unlimited card pool.	no

GiftsForgiven	Unrestricted	https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/list/5d5ddbd1107a72730e2a1873	It says a lot that all my basics are snow, and yet I am barely testing any snow payoffs from Kaldheim. A lot of them don't seem to scale up to powered cube very well, and that's okay. White got a lot of new toys, and while they may not represent a significant upgrade for the color, they're enough for me to remain interested. Plus, Valki is super cool.	basics

imoutogetyou	Unrestricted	https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/sua?view=spoiler	This set added a lot of really cheap legends and brought back legends matters cards. Seeing that wizards is going down this road my Legendary Creatures themed cube is hyped. Particularly nice that we got Esika and Kolvori in green which plays into the mono green legends with Reki. The MDFCs fill double slots and create legendary permanents which is really nice because it lets them fill multiple slots. Halvar and Toralf likely go in to double as equipment in Boros, while the Prismatic bridge fits into the WUBRG matters decks with Jodah Jegantha, and Golos. Ringhart Crest ends up being phenomenal creature ramp and only the tenth 2CMC or less ramp source I have included. It is incredibly strong...	no
