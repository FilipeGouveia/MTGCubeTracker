2.5: Witherbloom Command"	"A very interesting set that I find notable for how different sections of the community approach it. For some, this set is fantastic, with tons of playables that fit their cubes (cubes on the ""Unpowered Fair Stuff"" island, mostly). For some, this set is lacking in playables and a step down from kaldheim, since the magecraft cards don't fit the archetypes they support.  For other still, this was a solidly mediocre set with some good (if uninteresting) options for gold cards."

Strixhaven is a welcome boost to enemy gold cards. We're seeing many ""Watchwolf""-style upgrades that dial up the flexibility and power of multicolor cards, especially XY costed cards. It isn't always the case that stringent mana costs deliver better returns (looking at you, Kwain), but I appreciate when sets like Strixhaven do capture the tension between power and castability."

There are also some nice role players that I'm not considering but I'm glad they exist as options e.g. Fracture.

2.8: Vanishing Verse"	"We were hoping for a lower power set, giving us a break from cube adjustments (strange thing to hope for as a cube curator). This set has been especially great in one department: instants and sorceries. Recently, ""spell creatures,"" swiss-army-knife creatures, and CMC 3 planeswalkers have dominated the landscape. So, we're happy to include quite a few spells and spell payoffs from this set. In general, we're always excited to add low CMC modal spells and build toward a higher density of Ins/Sor, especially instants (as it helps to avoid clogged battlefields and improve the format feel).  To those ends, this set delivered big. Notes: For Orzhov, we decided to add Vanishing Verse over one of our signpost Aristocrats cards, expanding on that guild's role in chroma control. For Simic, it doesn't seem like many are testing Decisive Denial, but we expect it to shine in the UG flash archetype. Finally, we're testing Leonin Lightscribe and Sedgemoor Witch despite a dearth of white Ins/Sor and a creature-heavy black section. These inclusions help justify a Dup Young Pyromancer, Raven's Crime, and Flame Jab as borderline playable cards in our cube. "

First Day of Class is the card I'm really excited for, as it adds an interesting combo element (especially with Putrid Goblin and a sac outlet), but I want to make sure the combo is enjoyable to play with and against.

Note for my ratings, I try and keep my cube as open to new/inexperienced players as I can. Pillarfield Rescuer is worse than Custodi Squire in constructed, but Squire isn't even in my cube because of how unintuitive the voting mechanics are in 1v1. For that reason I'm very excited about Pillarfield Rescuer."

Curate is a real neat cantrip. It's just an instant version of Discovery // Dispersal's draw effect, and that's actually pretty solid in a lot of builds. (Unkeyworded) Surveil 2, draw one, is a good effect if you want stuff in the graveyard, and my cube does.

I'm honestly most excited for LOOT BOOTS. Zephyr Boots is such an awesome card. I think every deck in my cube would want to play it. Definitely looking at a staple.

I will add the campuses whenever they become a complete cycle.

If Zimone doesn't work out, Decisive Denial is a really neat modal spell. I think Zimone is going to be a good fit though.

I think blue 3's are really getting out of hand. That's a good thing and a bad thing simultaneously. I cut Frost Lynx (rip frien) for Merchant Raiders for my commander legends update, so this really isn't it. What 2-for-1 3-drop do I cut? I don't want my entire blue 3-drop section to be 2/2 flying 2-for-1's. 

It makes choices meaningless if all the options are not distinct."

I'm playing with every lesson in the land box. This makes Professor of Symbology a first pickable card, and an exciting card for white.

If I think Prof of Sym is first pickable, then Hunt for Specimens must be playable, right?

I've had at least 3 drafts with these some of these cards (the commands have had 6 drafts), so my ratings are less just random estimates!"

Im disappointed that Learn/Lessons were so low power level, very difficult mechanic to fit into a cube without strange draft rules (and my cube is build around rotisserie drafting). 

The Prismari treasure focus is interesting, I wish more spells had been given the U/R U/R pitch for treasure tokens ability, as that seems fun. 

Lorehold brought less to the table, as their mechanics didn't really mesh well with my cubes boros archetypes, nor do I support spirit tribal.

Witherbloom also brought little to the table for my cube, though the 2 daemons were quick additions.

Silverquill brought some interesting removal spells, but easily had the weakest of the command cycle.

Magecraft is an good choice, but many of the cards dont really do much with their magecraft effects outside of limited archetypes sadly. Sedgemoor witch being the noteworthy exception. 

The only planeswalker I added was the Lukka, which is mostly because I think Mila fits well. Rowan/Will is too slow, and Professor Onyx is just underwhelming.

The Dean cycle was very exciting as well, with a ton of options."

Learn is also a mechanic that doesn't lend itself to cube well. Although the mechanic itself can work well even without any Lesson cards, the ""additive distraction"" factor (as M.R. calls it) is real, and drafters will surely expect to see Lesson cards or forget that Learn allows you to rummage in the first place.

Those who are okay running Abrade or Sleight of Hand in their gold sections will find picks for their lists – most of the Commands; Fracture, Humiliate and Vanishing Verse; and Rip Apart – but for me they are just plain boring. The Elder Dragons cycle is also unexciting.

However, there are individual cards I expect to become staples. Elite Spellbinder is insane, Curate is top 3 2CMC cantrips, Conspiracy Theorist is unique and fun. But day 1 into EDH precon spoilers, it seems most of the new inclusions in my cube this time around will be from Precon decks.

PS: Abundant Harvest has me WILDLY excited about MH2."

Strixhaven as a set feels really cool, but its mechanics aren't things that really translate to cube for me. The learn mechanic isn't something I find compelling enough to support, and heavy instant/sorcery cards are hard to find room for in large enough quantities.

That being said, I am excited about the quantity and quality of cards I'm adding. It isn't an extreme change like ZNR was, but I'm pretty confident that each of the cards I'm adding will stick around for a while except possibly the MDFC which suffers from being in a guild slot."

2.5: Expressive Iteration"	I think this set is very successful in that the enemy color pairs each have a new and unique identity. Lorehold is much different than Boros of Ravnica even though they each share the same color pair. I was nervous that we'd just end up with five schools which feel and play like the guilds of Ravnica. I also really enjoy some of the super flavorful names of cards like Pop Quiz, Flunk, Snow Day, Teach by Example, Go Blank, Field Trip, First Day of Class, etc. Overall, I'm excited about Strixhaven and think it has plenty of cool cards that can make a splash in some of the power optimized cubes as well unique cards that will get other players excited for whatever kind of cube they're building.

The quality of monowhite and monoblack removal especially makes cards like Rip Apart, Vanishing Verse, and Fracture tough sells.

If they push white spells just a little further it could become a really neat archetype. Perhaps in cubes with other restrictions as well.

Love the multitude of modal spells and charms/commands. This is the set that finally pushes me to play the flip cards.

Art is boring and ugly, largely. Reminds me a bit of BFZ. This isn't a major consideration for me, but it's a small consideration for everyone regardless of whether they acknowledge it, imo."

In addition, Witherbloom has a nice lifegain theme. Seeing as my Golgari section's archetype is lifegain, most of my additions from this set will be Witherbloom cards.

The MDFC design is so heinous that we are not testing any of them for cleanliness reasons.  This is a shame, because some of them have a face that would have been testable as a mono-colored card, with a significantly less interesting side tacked on.  You could test the good side as a mono card, but if the attractive side of the card is on the back then it looks bizarre when opening packs.  Our format is digital and we play through Arena, so there isn't a clean way to just turn the card around in the pack and make a house rule that it's a mono card. These could have aligned with ZNR/KLD and been mono-color with a consistent card type on the back half (maybe a spellcaster creature front/their signature instant/sorcery on the back).

I am excited by some of the new guild identities explored in the set, but they didn't pick consistent themes to give cube curators full packages.  Boros has....reanimation, cards leaving the graveyard, spirit tribal AND spells matter.  Narrow this down to 2 subthemes that overlap well and we're talking.  The new Boros themes do excite me for future design, but we didn't get a coherent package to retheme the guild.

Specifically most of the differences are not good for my cube environment but for other formats. If there are more support added for the new themes in future sets then I might revisit the new outlooks on the guilds in this set. I did however really appreciate the RW Lorehold cards more than the rest as RW was a guild that was ""messy"" in my cube and this might clean it up. Same for WB.

Lesson and learn cards seem a little much too parasitic for my taste.

Lorehold for instance allows cube designers to explore a new archetype for RW, but would require a LARGE overhaul of many people's environments to make work. Similarly, since the set is heavily gold focused, many people's cubes simply don't have the space for many of the fancy new pieces.

One thing I would like to point out for peasant though is that Strixhaven singlehandily opens up a new archetype for BW in +1/+1 counters. The archetype has been seeing more support, but this is the first set with a +1/+1 counter signpost card.

I'm giving frost trickster a lower grade for my cube, because it might be too strong for my environment."

I have a relatively tight multicolored section, so it is hard to break in, but I like what Prismari is doing with treasures and generating mana from tapping them with Galazeth. This slots in great with Urza, Goldspan Dragon, Magda, and Hullbreacher.
Baleful Mastery has a ton of hype behind it, but it is in direct competition with Eliminate. It will be interesting to see which plays better. Obviously Baleful Mastery gains points in environments looking to cheat on mana costs. "

I'm a 'no' on both because MDFCs present logistical issues and seem difficult to play for people who aren't nerds like us with 10s of thousands of cards memorized, and because the lesson package seems to demand a lot more space than I'm willing to play with."

Cards like Conspiracy Theorist and Plargg, Dean of Chaos are welcome includes to discard themes in red, and Sedgemoor Witch (which didn't initially excite me) has proven thus far to be a great variant of Young Pyromancer.

Unfortunately, many people seem to be getting caught up on Trinket Text or the EDH-Centric cards that are not particularly Cube-worthy and are dismissing the set as mediocre. Combined with the fact that the best cards in the set are interactive role-players as opposed to splashy threats, people's opinions of the set are severely depressed.

Multicolors can only fit in 0/5 monocolor Decks, 1/10 duelcolor decks,  3/10 threecolor decks, 3/5 fourcolor decks and 1/1 allcolor decks . 8/30

Mono colored cards are in a standart cube playable in more decks (1/5, 5/10, 5/10, 3/5 and 1/1) -> 16/30

So more multicolors mean less cards to test for me (as i like my cards in the multicolor slots and they are mostly pretty strong too)"

stoophan	Unrestricted	https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/stephan	1.3: Elite Spellbinder	This set seems weaker than the average set. The learn package isn't strong enough for cube, and although some of the MDFC deans could be interesting to test, their high complexity and the fact they would be in the multicolor section of my cube, none could make the cut.
